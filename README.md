# graphdiff
This repository provides tools for converting graph representations and computing graph kernels for similarity analysis. It includes functionality to convert edge lists representation of graphs to adjacency matrices, create a graph representation from instances in the USE environment (.SOIL), and compute graph similarities using GraKeL.

## Installation
Python 2 is required for GrakeL library. (Python 2.7.18)
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
